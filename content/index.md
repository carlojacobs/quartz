![](/attachments/288BEE9F-77AD-44CE-B9A4-611BD7F2382B.jpg)Welcome! I’m Carlo. You have stumbled upon my webpage. I [[Website log|launched this site]] with the aim of sharing some of the notes that I have taken so far in my life, as well as to throw out into the world some of the things I have written so far. It might not be much, but it is growing and will one day (I hope) be a useful and fun resource.

I am a student studying at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl) in the Netherlands, currently finishing my double bachelor’s degree in mathematics and physics, but moving on to a master’s in medicine this August. For an overview of my endeavours so far, see my [[Resume|resume]].

You might want to visit my collection of [[10 Meta/Quartz/Pages/Medicine|medical notes]].
