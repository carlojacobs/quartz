## 1. Rhythm

Is there a P-wave before every QRS-complex? If yes, sinus rhythm, if no, arrhythmia.

## 2. Rate

$$
\text{HF} = \frac{300}{\text{Number of boxes between R-waves}}
$$

## 3. QRS-complex

Normal width is less than 3 small, if it is bigger then it is abnormal.

## 4. Axis

Look at the QRS complexes in lead Eindhoven I and AvF. 

| I   | AvF | Conclusion           |
| --- | --- | -------------------- |
| +   | +   | Normal               |
| +   | -   | Left axis deviation  |
| -   | +   | Right axis deviation |


## 5. Intervals

Normal:
- PR < 200ms
- QRS < 120ms
- QT < half the RR interval

## 6. ST-segment

If there is elevation, think MI or pericarditis. If there is depression, think ischemia or old MI.
