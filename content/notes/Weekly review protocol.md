# Weekly review protocol

Revised 25.1.25 (Google Drive and Notes Inbox are now the same).

Revised 14.5.25 (adjusted things for tags as new area’s)

What I need to do:

* Process Things inbox
* Process notes & files from the inbox
* Plan week in things (add items to anytime)
* Clear email inbox
* Clear downloads folder
* Clear bin
* ~~Clear Readwise inbox~~
* ~~Move Readwise items from Later to Archive~~
* Process remaining notes in pocket notebook

Final protocol in order:

1. Clear downloads folder (sort or delete)
2. Clear bin (check for mistakes, then delete everything)
4. Clear email inbox (move important emails to calendar, tasks or notes/files)
5. ~~Clear Readwise inbox~~
6. ~~Move Readwise items from Later to Inbox, if you haven't review them for a long time~~
7. Review calendar for new tasks or notes (-2 and +4 weeks)
8. Process remaining notes in pocket notebook
9. Clear notes & files inbox
10. Clear todo inbox
   11. Move everything to an area or project
   12. Set tags for remaining items
   13. Set deadlines
   14. Move everything to someday, except if it obviously belongs in anytime
   15. Click OK, then move what’s left to anytime
16. Plan weekly todo’s
    1. Go through anytime and eliminate if necessary
    2. Go through someday and add to anytime if desired
    3. Go through anytime again and set due dates if desired
